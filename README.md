# DwK-2025

This repository contains the exercises submitted for the DevOps with Kubernetes course from the University of Helsinki. Since applications used for deployment are written for the course and any language and frameworks are allowed, applications will be written using Rust. When client-side applications become more robust, Next.js will be used for learning purposes.
